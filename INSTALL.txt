# Installation Instructions

This project consists of a React frontend and a Python backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js and npm**: Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
-   **Python 3.10+**: Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   **uv**: Install using `pip install uv` or refer to [https://astral.sh/uv/install/](https://astral.sh/uv/install/)

## Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd map-app
    ```

2.  **Frontend Setup (React)**:
    Navigate to the project root directory.
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
    To run the frontend in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Backend Setup (Python)**:
    Navigate to the project root directory.
    Create a virtual environment using `uv`:
    ```bash
    uv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    Install the Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    uv run python data/data_server.py
    ```
    (Note: You might need to adjust the command to run the server based on its actual entry point and how it's designed to be run, e.g., using `uvicorn` if it's a FastAPI app.)

## Running the Application

1.  Start the backend server (as described in step 3 of Backend Setup).
2.  Start the frontend (as described in step 2 of Frontend Setup, using `npm run dev` for development or serving the `dist` folder for production).

The application should now be accessible in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port indicated by `npm run dev`).
